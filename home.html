            <h3>About Me</h3>
            My name is Ricky Pruitt, but I usually go by Nick.
                My major is Management Information Systems at the University of Nebraska - Omaha.
                I separated from the military a year ago,
                and I still work on base as a contracted Systems Administrator.
                I built a PC a few years ago, so I play video games on that often.
                I like to read, play chess, and/or relax with a cigar in my free time.
                My wife, dog, and cats keep me busy most of the time.
